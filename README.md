# Improving News Headline Text Generation Quality Through Frequent POS-Tag Patterns Analysis

This repository contains the code and data for the research paper "Improving News Headline Text Generation Quality Through Frequent POS-Tag Patterns Analysis". The paper presents a method for enhancing the quality of generated news headlines by analyzing the frequent POS-tag patterns in the training data and integrating them into the text generation model.

The repository includes the following components:

- `data`: Preprocessed training data used in the paper
- `models`: Source code for the text generation model, implemented in Python with PyTorch
- `HPPE`: Headline post-processing script for selecting generated headlines based on POS Tags matching.
- `examples`: Generated headlines and their corresponding POS-tag patterns

To use the code, please follow the instructions in the README.md file. The repository is open-source and welcomes contributions from the community.
